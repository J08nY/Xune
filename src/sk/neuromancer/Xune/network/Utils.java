         * Implementation Overview.
         *
         * This is an implementation of the xoroshiro128++ algorithm version 1.0,
         * written in 2019 by David Blackman and Sebastiano Vigna (vigna@acm.org).
         *
         * The jump operation moves the current generator forward by 2*64
         * steps; this has the same effect as calling nextLong() 2**64
         * times, but is much faster.  Similarly, the leap operation moves
         * the current generator forward by 2*96 steps; this has the same
         * effect as calling nextLong() 2**96 times, but is much faster.
         * The copy method may be used to make a copy of the current
         * generator.  Thus one may repeatedly and cumulatively copy and
         * jump to produce a sequence of generators whose states are well
         * spaced apart along the overall state cycle (indeed, the jumps()
         * and leaps() methods each produce a stream of such generators).
         * The generators can then be parceled out to other threads.
         *
         * File organization: First the non-public methods that constitute the
         * main algorithm, then the public methods.  Note that many methods are
         * defined by classes {@link AbstractJumpableGenerator} and {@link AbstractGenerator}.
